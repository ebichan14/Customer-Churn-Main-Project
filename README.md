Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn in the telecom industry. Leveraging Python, MySQL, and Power BI tools, we delve into understanding the factors influencing customer attrition and devise strategies to mitigate churn rates.

Motivation
In today's highly competitive telecom market, retaining customers is paramount. Understanding why customers leave and identifying potential churners beforehand can significantly impact business profitability and sustainability. This project aims to provide actionable insights to telecom providers for effective churn management.

Methodology

Data Collection: We gather comprehensive telecom customer data from various sources, including subscription details, call records, and customer interactions.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and integrating data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we explore the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Deriving new features and selecting relevant variables to build predictive models.
Modeling: Employing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict customer churn.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize insights and facilitate decision-making.
Repository Structure
Data: Contains raw and processed datasets.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks documenting the analysis workflow.
Scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Reports: Power BI reports showcasing interactive visualizations.
Documentation: Additional documentation, including project objectives, methodology, and findings.

Results

Our analysis reveals key drivers of churn, including service usage patterns, contract type, customer demographics, and customer satisfaction metrics. By implementing targeted retention strategies based on these insights, telecom providers can proactively reduce churn rates and enhance customer loyalty.

Future Work

Integration of real-time data streams for dynamic churn prediction.
Implementation of advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks and ensemble methods.
Deployment of predictive models into production environments for real-world application.
